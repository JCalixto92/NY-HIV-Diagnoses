    <!-- BODY OF STORY GOES HERE - KEEP IT CUTE!-->

    <p>Across the five boroughs of New York City, there has been an increase in HIV diagnoses between 2022 to 2023, according to the New York City Department of Health.</a></p>

        <!-- DON'T FORGET AN EXPERT QUOT -->
    <p>“I believe there were two important things that happened during the SARS-CoV-2 [COVID-19] emergency that affected HIV diagnoses in 2022 and 2023” said Denis Nash, a professor of Epidemiology and executive director of CUNY’s Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health.</p>

    </div> 

    <p>The annual <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/ah/surveillance2023-tables-all.pdf">HIV Surveillance Statistics</a> report documents new diagnoses between January 1st and December 31st of each year. The report showed that boroughs like Staten Island saw the biggest percentage increase of 40% with 45 new diagnoses in 2023, compared to 32 diagnoses in 2022. While Brooklyn had 427 diagnoses in 2022, and 468 diagnoses in 2023. Brooklyn is the borough with the highest number of diagnoses as of 2023.</p>
    
    <p>Nash attributes the increase in new diagnoses to the lack of access, both of preventative measures, like PrEP, and of HIV testing sites during the COVID-19 pandemic. “HIV testing was severely reduced, which serves to delay HIV diagnoses that otherwise would have occurred in 2020/21 to later years when HIV testing became more widely available again,” he said.</p>
 
    <p>Dr. Christian Grov, a professor at the Department of Community Health and Social Sciences, also agrees that COVID-19 played a role in delayed testing. In a statement, he adds, “Now the city is catching up, those living with HIV are being identified with testing, and (the good news) being linked to care.”</p>
